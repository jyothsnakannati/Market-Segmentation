# Market-Segmentation
The purpose of marketing is to match the genuine needs and desires of consumers with the offers of suppliers particularly suited to satisfy those needs and desires.
A marketing plan consists of two components: a strategic and a tactical marketing plan. The strategic plan outlines the long-term direction of an organisation, but does not provide much detail on shortterm marketing action required to move in this long-term direction.
